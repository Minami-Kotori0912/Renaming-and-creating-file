As the name shows: this programme use python to create files with specific suffix like "test_1.txt", "test_2.txt" and "test_3.txt" as well as "test_a.txt", "test_b.txt" and "test_c.txt"
and renaming files by adding prefix or suffix (for example: example.txt -> for_example.txt)
Looking forward to your comments and advice!
